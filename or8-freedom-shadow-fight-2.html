Many of us seem to think that Battle for Azeroth will have a similar ending as we had in Mists of Pandaria, namely: Siege of Orgrimmar 2.0. Although while I believe that with Sylvanas we will fight another 'corrupt' warchief in 8.3, I don't think we will go to Orgrimmar, but rather to Stormwind . Here's why. Those who read the Before the Storm novel by Christie Golden know that one of the chapters has a interesting ending, when Sylvanas speaks with Nathanos: EDIT: Some glaring things that needed edited were edited. Notes explaining contention added. Trying to close more gaps. Not back to the drawing board just yet, but lots of deep edits to be had, haha. EDIT: Who gave me gold?! Thanks so much. amp#x200B; Trihsmegistus here (just say "T," Tris, or Triscuits. They all work). Long time Destiny player and avid fan of the lore. This post began from me reading the Book: Dust, and being fascinated with wanting to find out which If you missed it, last week's thread may be found here (https://redd.it/bb9e0k). The following were the most popular releases of last week (April 3rd): Amazing Spider-Man #19 (https://redd.it/bbp1nn) Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #5 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/bb9e0k/new_marvel_comics_and_releases_for_april_10th/ekhui6c/) Captain Marvel #4 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/bb9e0k/new_marvel_comics_and_releases_for_april_10th/ekhu9cn/). parts 1amp2 Kira pressed his back tightly to the damp stone wall, clutching his sword in one hand and a torch in the other. It was the moment he'd been waiting for his entire life; what years of turmoil and training had brought him to. The climax of his existence. Something clinked from the adjacent room, like a dropped purse of gold, followed by a low growl and strange chittering. The smell of wet mineral and sulfur filled his nose, a chill setting into his spine. He took a deep breat. Hello! Been seeing a lot of confusion about what’s going on in the story lately in the manga, so I wrote up this summary of the manga that should hopefully answer the broad questions. Season 1 finished at Chapter 33, Season 2 finished at Chapter 50, Season 3 Part 1 left off at Chapter 72, and the latest chapter was Chapter 116. This is a very rough summary, and misses a lot of details, since it becomes very complicated. The story can be divided into Arcs, each one roughly 16-20 chapters long. 
Edit: THANK YOU FOR MY FIRST GOLD! 4 LONG YEARS! \ \ Info taken directly from Official Playstation Blog (https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/change/). Every game tested Masterpost!

Unless you were part of the beta testing program as other beta testers have started to confirm. The writing was on the wall about Daenerys not getting the throne from the beginning. Her whole series arc was about The corruption of Power that even some of the most altruistic couldn't hope to escape. Daenerys started with no power and was sold by her brother Viserys as a Broodmare to the barbarian Khal Drogo for his chance to retake the Seven Kingdoms. She was raped by him repeatedly. Through her handmaiden's she learned the power a woman has/can attain in a marriage. To make Drogo. TL;DR: The way Adam's arc went was serviceable, but with better build-up and characterization, could've enforced the themes of Blake's arc a lot better, and been much more meaningful aka: my hot take no one asked for. Sorry for the ambiguous title, I'm trying to make sure people read this instead of down-voting it on instinct. I know Adam threads are a dead horse at the moment, but I've thought about the topic for a while, and came to some conclusions about it. I'll start this off by sayin. What is the Oculus Quest? "Oculus Quest is the world’s first all-in-one gaming system built for virtual reality." The Quest is Oculus' first stand-alone virtual reality headset featuring 6 degree of freedom (6DoF) inside-out tracking with two 6DoF controllers. This means that you can experience VR while moving around your room with no computer, wires, tethers, or external sensors. You're able to put the Quest on and jump into VR immediately with no setup or additional equipment required. With permission from u/JonCreaux, I am combining his Information and FAQ sticky with my Game and App Lists for a combined sticky, and will keep them up to date, to the best of my ability.

With only a week left for my Nightmare Cup weighted tournament, my playtesting takes a more serious approach. Having toyed around with lots of options, it's now time to define my team. Since there wasn't much discussion about it (leaderboards stole the lights ofc), I'll share my initial thoughts on teambuilding for the Nightmare Cup. First things first: it's not a coincidence that there's still no word about a Pokémon that will define the meta. The typing selection, and most importantly This episode was billed as a story from long ago. I knew it would be told from Dom’s perspective, so at best it would be mostly hearsay, and at worst, a tale, designed to protect Katarina’s current identity, get Liz to back off investigating things. I suspected it would be, as all in The Blacklist, ambiguous. All theories at full sail, a bit for each in there. Dom does not feel sad as he tells Liz the story. There is a gleam in his eyes, and consider 
“If a human is not free, don’t trust a word it says. And if you have taken it away from him. You much watch it every second. If not, it will kill you the moment you look away.” A poem popularized by the Faithful Markra. (His human name.) When he wrote this in his book: A history of the people of Earth, he was talking about our independence war. The Mortuus had build an empire the universe had never seen before. But instead of colonizing it they just subjected species in to their so-called. Context: Less than 3,000 Raven Guard have survived the Dropsite Massacre, when they arrive back at Deliverance they suffer another attack, this time by the Mechanicum; manipulated by Omegon and emboldened by the Raven Guard's losses the "Order of the Dragon" attacks the Raven Guard at Ravendelve but are defeated. Now Corax has scraped together the remains of his Legion and is planning a campaign to show Horus the Raven Guard haven't been knocked out of action. gtMounting the stage, the prima. VOD (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/397952378) Player support post (https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a-message-from-player-support) These updates are being released on 25 March. Chargebow fix: 'looking to release soonish.' Dead clicks are being investigated whether it's the server or the content that is the issue. Orion's fix needs to be heavily tested because it affects the deeper code of the combat system. (https://twitter.com/JagexOrion/status/1101226444309565441) Freedo. Context: As part of his larger plan to unleash a warpstorm in the Ultramar System Lorgar takes Angron back to Nuceria to confront his former owners. This is what transpires when they first arrive at the old battleground where The Emperor teleported Angron up and away from the battle. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Khârn walked across the field of bones, listening to the ghosts in the wind. This high in the mountains, the wind had a howling edge. gtbe me; Old LizarDM gtbe not me; human ranger (Finn), human monk (Reyna), shifter druid (Camila), half orc fighter (Devin), elf artificer (Ariana), genasi warlock (Werhan), warforged bard (Be Bop) gtthe party watch as Mr Xhorveen begins to walk back up the stairs, until finally, he climbs out of sight gtthe druid looks around and sees Dielm, Mr Xhorveen’s doorman, walk back towards them, arms crossed gt“Mr Xhorveen has asked me to hear what you have learnt on the mission gtbe me; Old LizarDM gtbe not me; human ranger (Finn), human monk (Reyna), shifter druid (Camila), half orc fighter (Devin), elf artificer (Ariana), genasi warlock (Werhan), warforged bard (Be Bop) gtdarkness explodes from the warlock’s hand, filling the room and blasting against the elf and the druid gtthe windows shatter as the darkness reaches them and downstairs, the monk is thrown bodily aside into a table as it hits her too gtoutside, every window on the entire block shatters. gt"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer." gt-The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde-. </p>
